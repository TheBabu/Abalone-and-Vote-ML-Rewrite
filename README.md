# Abalone-and-Vote-ML-Rewrite
### A rewrite of some old machine learning projects using Tensorflow 2 and Keras

When I first wrote my Abalone and Vote Machine Learning Projects, they mainly utilized Tensorflow 1. This project rewrites those old projects using Tensorflow 2 and Keras, a high-level API for ML. The reason why I wanted to do this is that first off, when doing this project it was during the COVID-19 pandemic and I was really bored and secondly I wanted to learn the more "proper" way of utilizing Tensorflow. 

What ended up is I was able to create a more clear and concise code, and arguably performed better than my previous model. So I would consider this project a success. My next goal is to create a more applicable ML project or even a more "fun" project with maybe a way for an AI to play games.
